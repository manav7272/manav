          <p>
            I'm a founder, podcaster, and "growth guy" currently building in the creator economy space.
          </p>

          <p>
            I host <strong>The Manav Podcast</strong>, where I interview top founders, operators, and investors on how their playbook to Win.
          </p>

          <p>
            My goal is to build the world's most influential entrepreneurship podcast.
          </p>

          <p>
            Over the last 5 years, my businesses have generated 8-figures in revenue, spanning media, growth consulting,
            creator platforms, and AI-driven products. I specialize in growth, distribution, and taking ideas from 0 → 1.
          </p>

          <p>
            I'm currently building and advising ventures at the intersection of AI, creators, and distribution,
            including UGC platforms, media brands, and automation-first agencies. I've never raised venture capital and
            prefer building with leverage, speed, and control.
          </p>

          <p>
            Before this, I moved from India to the US with no safety net and learned by building—shipping products,
            running experiments, and learning in public.
          </p>

          <p>
            Outside of work, I play polo, train intensely (weights, hot yoga, endurance), host IRL founder events,
            and obsess over systems for freedom, focus, and love watching documentaries.
          </p>
